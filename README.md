# RSA-Encryption-in-Python
Exercises in Python notebook to implement the RSA encryption algorithm, and figure out if huge numbers are primes via Fermat test. 

Carmichael_numbers.ipynb	:  Checks whether given number is Carmichael or not. Also prints the 5th,etc Carmichael numbers.
Fermat_test_for primes.ipynb	:  
RSA_Encryption.ipynb	:   
RSA_Encryption_with_ED_input.ipynb	 :  
seccap_constants190624.py  :  Used in the above files, for declaring global constants (the input cases and keys).
